# Introduction

Asula is a novel Proof of Stake, Layer-1 blockchain optimized to provide verification for Rollups, backed by the cryptoeconomic security of Bitcoin. Asula provides a shared settlement and verification layer to verify a rapidly expanding ecosystem of rollups on Bitcoin.

By providing a shared layer for settlement on Bitcoin, we accelerate the utility of Bitcoin as an asset beyond its primary use as a store of value today and unlock more expressive applications and usecases.&#x20;
