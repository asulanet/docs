# Asula L1

Asula is built on top of Cosmos SDK, a production-ready and mature framework that uses the CometBFT consensus engine to build Proof of Stake blockchains. Both have proven track records of powering blockchains at scale, as well as strong developer support.

Asula and all rollups built on it will have access to IBC out of the box, enabling fluid interoperability with the rest of the Cosmos ecosystem, including Noble, DYDX, Osmosis and other fast-growing chains.

Asula achieves interoperability between rollups by verifying the state of each rollup on the L1 through proof verification. Proofs can be Optimistic or ZK.
