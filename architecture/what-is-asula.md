# What is Asula?

Asula is a novel Proof of Stake, Layer-1 blockchain optimized to verify rollup state and settle assets between them. The Asula network’s security is derived from the economic value of Bitcoin staked to the protocol, made possible by [Babylon](https://www.babylonchain.io/)’s Bitcoin Staking Protocol. Asula acts as a shared settlement layer and liquidity hub for a growing ecosystem of rollups.
